  <p>Hiring Team<br/>Neo Financial<br/>Calgary, AB</p>

  <p>Dear Hiring Team,</p>

  <p>I’m applying for the Senior Associate, Corporate FP&A role. My background combines company-level cash flow planning, rolling forecasts, KPI reporting, and automation that speeds recurring analysis. I partner effectively with business leaders and translate drivers into clear plans and executive-ready narratives.</p>

  <p>Through PrairieSignal, I’ve delivered reporting packs and dashboards supporting budget vs. forecast, variance commentary, and cash flow visibility. Previously at Rosen Capital Advisors, I led a platform integration that standardized compliance/ops processes and delivered $120K/year in vendor savings—evidence of an improvement mindset and cross-functional execution. Earlier private equity experience sharpened my modeling, scenario planning and memo-writing under tight timelines.</p>

  <p>I’m excited to support Neo’s growth with robust corporate planning, scenario-ready models, and KPIs that keep leadership aligned. I’m Calgary-based and comfortable operating at pace while maintaining accuracy, documentation, and stakeholder trust.</p>

  <p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br/>Drew Williams</p>
