  <p>Hiring Committee<br/>
  University of Calgary, Facilities Development, Capital Renewal<br/>
  Calgary, AB</p>

  <p>Dear Hiring Committee,</p>

  <p>
    I am applying for the Financial Analyst (Capital Reporting) position supporting the University of Calgary's Capital Program. My finance background (B.Comm, Distinction from Haskayne) and hands-on experience building monthly reporting packs, reconciliations, and audit-ready documentation align directly with the University's need for accurate budgeting, forecasting, and variance analysis across capital projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through PrairieSignal, I design lightweight reporting automations that work with existing tools—Excel, SQL exports, and data warehouse/BI feeds—to deliver monthly capital packs with budget vs. actuals, variance commentary, and KPI summaries. Reconciliations, approvals tracking, and version control are embedded so each cycle is simpler and more reliable. I focus on ensuring expenditures are properly documented, grant terms are respected, and project managers and directors receive timely, actionable information.
  </p>

  <p>
    Previously at Rosen Capital Advisors, I served as the primary analyst for an SPX weekly options volatility arbitrage strategy. I maintained hedge books, Greeks, and derivatives exposure models that guided capital allocation, co-authored quarterly and annual investor letters, and produced fact sheets and diligence models. Alongside that portfolio work, I led a compliance and operations platform integration that reduced vendor spend by $120K annually while standardizing reporting cadence across Legal, IT, and Operations. That experience honed my ability to structure complex problems, align stakeholders, and deliver precise outputs under pressure—skills directly relevant to capital program reporting and government submissions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am comfortable working inside enterprise environments (PeopleSoft project codes, internal controls checklists, cross-functional coordination) and have exposure to public-sector reporting considerations (PSAS familiarity).
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for considering my application ahead of the October 7 deadline. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can support Facilities Development in delivering accurate, timely capital reporting across construction and planning portfolios.
  </p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br/>
  Drew Williams</p>
