  <p>Global Client Group Hiring Team<br/>
  Brookfield Asset Management<br/>
  Toronto, ON</p>

  <p>Dear Hiring Team,</p>

  <p>
    I am applying for the Analyst/Associate position in Brookfield’s Global Client Group. I bring a finance background alongside hands-on
    experience producing investor-facing materials, maintaining CRM data integrity, and automating analytics that inform fundraising and
    relationship management.
  </p>

  <p>
    As an independent builder I have designed dashboards that combine CRM exports, performance KPIs, and pipeline data into executive-ready
    narratives. I standardize notes, follow-up actions, and segmentation fields so teams can personalize outreach at scale. Earlier at
    Rosen Capital Advisors I owned client-ready materials, coordinated cross-functional inputs, and led a compliance/operations integration
    that improved reporting cadence while saving $120K annually. These projects reinforced my attention to detail, documentation discipline,
    and ability to communicate complex information succinctly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Brookfield’s global reach and solution-oriented culture are compelling to me. I thrive in collaborative settings where data hygiene,
    insight generation, and crisp storytelling directly support capital raising and client engagement. I am confident I can quickly contribute
    to the Global Client Group’s reporting rhythm and CRM initiatives.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to bring analytics, automation, and investor communications
    expertise to Brookfield.
  </p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br/>
  Drew Williams</p>
