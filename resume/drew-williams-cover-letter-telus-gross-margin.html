  <h1>Senior Financial Analyst – Gross Margin Planning, TELUS</h1>

  <p>Hiring Committee<br/>
  TELUS, Consumer Wireless Finance<br/>
  Toronto, ON</p>

  <p>Dear Hiring Committee,</p>

  <p>
    I am applying for the Senior Financial Analyst – Gross Margin Planning position (12-month contract) with TELUS's Consumer Wireless Finance team. I hold a B.Comm (Finance, Distinction) from the University of Calgary and bring hands-on experience in financial analysis, forecasting, margin analysis and data automation using SQL and Python.
  </p>

  <p>
    At PrairieSignal (prairiesignal.ca), my AI and reporting automation consultancy, I design practical reporting automations that plug into the tools clients already rely on—Excel, SQL exports and collaborative suites. I automate KPI reporting using SQL and Python, reducing preparation time and enabling quicker executive decisions on pricing and cost management. This experience directly aligns with TELUS's need for data automation and advanced SQL/GCP proficiency to optimize gross margin forecasting and analysis.
  </p>

  <p>
    Previously at Rosen Capital Advisors, I produced P&L, exposure and risk analytics used in investment reviews; analyzed revenue, cost and margin drivers to inform capital allocation decisions. I also led a compliance and operations platform integration that standardized reporting cadence and delivered $120K per year in vendor savings and improved margin visibility. The role required coordination across multiple functions and sharpened my ability to influence senior leaders with data-driven insights—skills directly relevant to collaborating with TELUS Marketing on pricing strategies.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am excited about the opportunity to own gross margin forecasting and analysis for TELUS Consumer Wireless, perform detailed variance analysis, develop dashboards highlighting margin trends, and collaborate with Marketing to provide finance input on rate plan changes and device promos. I am comfortable with the 12-month contract nature of this role. Thank you for your consideration.
  </p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br/>
  Drew Williams</p>
