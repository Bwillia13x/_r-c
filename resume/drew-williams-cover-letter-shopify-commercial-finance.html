  <p>Hiring Committee<br/>
  Shopify, Commercial Finance<br/>
  Remote, Canada</p>

  <p>Dear Hiring Committee,</p>

  <p>
    I am applying for the Senior Financial Analyst – Commercial Finance role with Shopify. I hold a B.Comm (Finance, Distinction) from the University of Calgary and bring hands-on experience in financial planning, business partnering and data-driven decision support.
  </p>

  <p>
    At PrairieSignal (prairiesignal.ca), my AI and reporting automation consultancy, I design practical reporting automations that plug into the tools clients already rely on—Excel, SQL exports and collaborative suites. I automate financial reporting using SQL and Python, reducing preparation time and enabling quicker strategic decisions. I partner with business leaders to align reporting to strategic priorities and deliver insights that drive operational improvements and cost optimization. This experience directly aligns with Shopify's need for financial analysts who can combine technical capabilities with business partnership to support fast-paced product and go-to-market teams.
  </p>

  <p>
    Previously at Rosen Capital Advisors, I built dashboards (Excel/Python) and management reports supporting risk, operations, and portfolio reviews. I also led a compliance and operations platform integration that standardized reporting cadence and delivered $120K per year in vendor savings while improving cross-functional collaboration. The role required partnering with diverse stakeholders across Legal, IT and Operations—skills directly relevant to collaborating with Shopify's product, marketing and sales teams.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am excited about the opportunity to partner with Shopify's business teams, build financial models and reporting systems that translate operational metrics into actionable insights, and leverage my SQL and Python skills to accelerate analysis cycles in support of Shopify's mission to make commerce better for everyone. I am well-suited for remote work and thrive in fast-paced tech environments. Thank you for your consideration.
  </p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br/>
  Drew Williams</p>
