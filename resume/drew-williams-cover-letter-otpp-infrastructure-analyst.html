  <p>Hiring Committee<br/>
  Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, Infrastructure & Natural Resources<br/>
  Toronto, ON</p>

  <p>Dear Hiring Committee,</p>

  <p>
    I am applying for the Investment Analyst position with OTPP's Infrastructure & Natural Resources team. I hold a B.Comm (Finance, Distinction) from the University of Calgary and bring hands-on experience building valuation models, conducting due diligence and producing investment memoranda for complex transactions.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a Private Equity Summer Analyst at Olson Cross & Alamo, I built DCF, IRR and waterfall models and drafted investment memoranda for $350M to $3.5B transactions in infrastructure and energy sectors. I conducted industry and company research to inform comparable analyses and investment recommendations, and supported transaction execution including due diligence coordination and documentation review. That experience strengthened my fundamentals in valuation, due diligence support and infrastructure investment analysis.
  </p>

  <p>
    Previously at Rosen Capital Advisors, I built dashboards (Excel/Python) and management reports supporting risk, operations, and portfolio reviews. I co-authored quarterly and annual investor letters with the PM and produced fact sheets and diligence models supporting fundraising and partner reviews. I also led a compliance and operations platform integration that standardized reporting cadence and delivered $120K per year in vendor savings, demonstrating my ability to drive process improvements alongside analytical work.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to OTPP's infrastructure and natural resources investment process, from building financial models and performing scenario analysis to preparing investment committee memoranda and monitoring portfolio companies. I am willing to relocate to Toronto and travel internationally as needed. Thank you for your consideration.
  </p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br/>
  Drew Williams</p>
