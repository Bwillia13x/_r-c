  <h1>Financial Analyst – Mining FP&A Team, Finning</h1>

  <p>Hiring Committee<br/>
  Finning Canada, Mining Division Finance<br/>
  Calgary, AB</p>

  <p>Dear Hiring Committee,</p>

  <p>
    I am applying for the Financial Analyst position supporting Finning's Mining division FP&A team. I hold a B.Comm (Finance, Distinction) from the University of Calgary and bring hands-on experience building financial models, producing monthly variance analysis, and delivering accurate reporting for complex operations.
  </p>

  <p>
    At PrairieSignal (prairiesignal.ca), my AI and reporting automation consultancy, I design practical reporting automations that plug into the tools clients already rely on—Excel, SQL exports and collaborative suites. I build monthly reporting packs with budget vs. actuals, variance commentary, and KPI dashboards; data validation, reconciliations and version control are embedded so each cycle is faster and audit-ready. This experience directly aligns with Finning's need for monthly, quarterly and annual financial reports with insightful variance commentary.
  </p>

  <p>
    Previously at Rosen Capital Advisors, I built dashboards (Excel/Python) and management reports supporting risk, operations, and portfolio reviews; maintained reconciliations and assumptions documentation. I also led a compliance and operations platform integration that standardized reporting cadence and delivered $120K per year in vendor savings. The role required coordination across Legal, IT and Operations and sharpened my attention to detail and data integrity—skills directly relevant to ensuring IFRS compliance and accurate financial records at Finning.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am excited about the opportunity to support Finning's mining business with financial models for forecasts and annual budgets, perform detailed variance analysis, and continuously improve reporting tools using advanced Excel and Power BI. Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to Finning's Mining FP&A team in Calgary.
  </p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br/>
  Drew Williams</p>
