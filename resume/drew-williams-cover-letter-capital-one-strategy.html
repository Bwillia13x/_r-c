  <p>Hiring Committee<br/>
  Capital One Canada, Strategy & Analytics<br/>
  Toronto, ON</p>

  <p>Dear Hiring Committee,</p>

  <p>
    I am applying for the Senior Associate – Corporate Strategy Analyst role with Capital One Canada's Strategy & Analytics group. I hold a B.Comm (Finance, Distinction) from the University of Calgary and bring hands-on experience in strategic analysis, financial modeling, competitive research and cross-functional project execution.
  </p>

  <p>
    Capital One's blend of rigorous analysis and innovative technology in banking greatly appeals to me. In my career, I have similarly used data and technology to solve complex problems. At PrairieSignal (prairiesignal.ca), my AI and reporting automation consultancy, I use Python/SQL automation to accelerate analysis cycles and enable quicker strategic decisions based on data insights. This data-driven approach aligns with Capital One's analytical culture and emphasis on test-and-learn methodologies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Previously at Rosen Capital Advisors, I led a compliance and operations platform integration that standardized processes and reporting cadence, delivering $120K per year in vendor savings—a strategic cost reduction initiative requiring cross-functional coordination with Legal, IT and Operations. This experience demonstrates my ability to identify and execute strategic initiatives that drive measurable business impact, similar to the projects I would tackle at Capital One's Strategy team.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a Private Equity Summer Analyst at Olson Cross & Alamo, I conducted industry and company research including competitive analysis to inform investment recommendations and strategic assessments for $350M-$3.5B transactions. I built financial models and drafted investment memoranda that supported executive decision-making—experience directly applicable to developing business strategies and preparing strategy presentations for Capital One's senior management.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am excited about the opportunity to develop business strategies to drive growth, perform market research and analytics on competitors and emerging fintech trends, build financial models to assess profitability of new business opportunities, and prepare strategy presentations for Capital One Canada's executive team. I am willing to relocate to Toronto and work on-site as required. Thank you for your consideration.
  </p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br/>
  Drew Williams</p>
