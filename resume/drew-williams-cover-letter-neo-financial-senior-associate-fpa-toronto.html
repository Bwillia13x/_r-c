  <p>Hiring Team<br/>Neo Financial<br/>Toronto, ON</p>

  <p>Dear Hiring Team,</p>

  <p>I’m applying for the Senior Associate, FP&A role. I bring hands-on experience building forecasts and KPI dashboards, partnering cross-functionally to explain variances, and presenting insights that guide decisions. I’ve also automated recurring reporting in Excel/Python/SQL to improve speed and traceability.</p>

  <p>Most recently through my consultancy PrairieSignal, I’ve delivered monthly reporting packs (budget vs. forecast, variance commentary, KPIs) and lightweight automations that reduce manual effort. Earlier at Rosen Capital Advisors, I led a compliance/operations platform integration that standardized processes and produced $120K/year in vendor savings—evidence of a continuous improvement mindset and ability to coordinate with Legal, IT, and Operations. In private equity, I built DCF/IRR models and drafted memos for $350M–$3.5B transactions, developing disciplined modeling and communication fundamentals.</p>

  <p>I’m excited by Neo’s pace and product focus. The role’s emphasis on rolling forecasts, scenario planning, and dashboards for leadership aligns directly with my strengths. I’m comfortable collaborating with Lending stakeholders, translating drivers into models and clear narratives that support execution. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute in Toronto and help scale FP&A capabilities that keep up with growth.</p>

  <p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br/>Drew Williams</p>
