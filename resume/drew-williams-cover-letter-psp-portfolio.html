  <p>Hiring Committee<br/>
  PSP Investments<br/>
  Montréal, QC</p>

  <p>Dear Hiring Committee,</p>

  <p>
    I am applying for the Analyst/Senior Analyst, Portfolio Management role within PSP’s Infrastructure & Private Equity group. I bring a finance
    degree (B.Comm, Distinction) and practical experience building asset-level dashboards, valuation oversight models, and governance materials that
    keep investment teams, risk, and finance aligned.
  </p>

  <p>
    As an independent builder I constructed portfolio monitoring suites that track KPIs, valuation marks, capital plans, and governance milestones.
    Using Python/SQL/Excel automations I reconciled data sources, surfaced variance narratives, and packaged findings for investment committees.
    Previously at Rosen Capital Advisors I prepared board materials for portfolio companies, ran scenario analysis on capital allocation decisions,
    and led a compliance/ops integration that improved reporting cadence while saving $120K annually.
  </p>

  <p>
    PSP’s global infrastructure and PE holdings present the complexity and impact I’m eager to support. I enjoy partnering with deal teams and operating
    leaders, maintaining disciplined documentation, and ensuring recommendations are grounded in both financial and operational reality.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the chance to contribute to PSP’s portfolio governance, analytics, and strategic initiatives
    from day one.
  </p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br/>
  Drew Williams</p>
