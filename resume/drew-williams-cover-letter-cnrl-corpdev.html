  <p>Corporate Development Hiring Team<br/>
  Canadian Natural Resources Limited<br/>
  Calgary, AB</p>

  <p>Dear Hiring Team,</p>

  <p>
    I am applying for the Corporate Development Analyst position at CNRL. I bring upstream-focused financial modelling experience,
    repeatable diligence workflows, and a collaborative style that supports engineering, operations, and finance teams in screening
    acquisitions, divestitures, and portfolio trades.
  </p>

  <p>
    As an independent builder, I developed A&D evaluation engines that ingest production, reserves, and cost data to surface top-quartile
    opportunities. The analyses include decline-curve modelling, type-curve comparisons, and sensitivity toggles for commodity strips and
    operating synergies. Previously at Rosen Capital Advisors I coordinated multi-disciplinary diligence teams, built cash-flow and return
    models, and prepared investment committee materials for energy and infrastructure transactions ranging from $350M to $3.5B.
  </p>

  <p>
    CNRL’s scale, disciplined capital allocation, and appetite for opportunistic acquisitions are an ideal match for my skills. I understand
    the importance of grounding models in engineering assumptions, maintaining data provenance, and presenting concise recommendations that
    can move at the pace of deal negotiations.
  </p>

  <p>
    I would welcome the chance to support CNRL’s corporate development pipeline—providing valuation rigour, market intelligence, and organized
    execution across the evaluation lifecycle. Thank you for considering my application.
  </p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br/>
  Drew Williams</p>
