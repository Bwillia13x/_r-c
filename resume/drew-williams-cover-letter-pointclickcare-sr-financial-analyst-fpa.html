  <p>Hiring Team<br/>PointClickCare</p>

  <p>Dear Hiring Team,</p>

  <p>I’m applying for the Sr. Financial Analyst, FP&A role. I have hands-on experience supporting topline and gross margin analysis, building advanced Excel models (Power Query/Power Pivot), and designing KPI dashboards and BvA reporting for leadership. I enjoy partnering with GTM leaders and adopting AI/automation to improve analysis speed and quality.</p>

  <p>At PrairieSignal, I deliver bookings-to-ARR bridges, forecast packs with variance commentary, and GTM dashboards that give leaders clear levers and accountability. Previously at Rosen Capital Advisors, I led a platform integration that standardized processes and saved $120K/year in vendor spend—proof of a continuous improvement mindset and attention to detail. Earlier private equity work strengthened my modeling and scenario planning under tight timelines.</p>

  <p>I’m excited by PointClickCare’s mission and the role’s emphasis on topline, GAAP gross margin, and multi-horizon planning. I would look to evolve reporting that clarifies BvA drivers and helps set targets across quarterly, annual, and multi-year horizons while partnering closely with GTM leaders.</p>

  <p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br/>Drew Williams</p>
