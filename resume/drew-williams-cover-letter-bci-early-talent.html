  <p>Hiring Committee<br/>
  BC Investment Management Corporation, Infrastructure & Renewable Resources<br/>
  Victoria, BC</p>

  <p>Dear Hiring Committee,</p>

  <p>
    I am applying for BCI's Early Talent Program in Infrastructure & Renewable Resources (June 2026 start). I hold a B.Comm (Finance, Distinction, GPA 3.9) from the University of Calgary and bring hands-on experience in investment analysis, financial modeling and due diligence for infrastructure and energy transactions.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a Private Equity Summer Analyst at Olson Cross & Alamo, I completed valuation analysis on $350M-$3.5B portfolio of private infrastructure and energy companies during due diligence, identifying key value drivers that informed investment decisions. I conducted industry and company research to inform comparable analyses and collaborated on multi-disciplinary teams (finance, operations, legal) to evaluate potential transactions, contributing to investment memos that secured committee approval. That experience strengthened my fundamentals in infrastructure investment analysis and cross-functional teamwork.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have continued building on this foundation through independent financial analysis projects, where I optimized financial models via Python automation, reducing analysis time by 50% and enhancing scenario testing capabilities. This technical approach aligns with BCI's innovative culture and emphasis on developing advanced analytical skills across the rotational program.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am passionate about infrastructure and renewable resources investing because these assets shape critical systems—energy transition, sustainable forestry, agricultural resilience—while delivering stable long-term returns. I am eager to contribute to BCI's due diligence on direct private investments, develop sensitivity analyses, engage with portfolio companies, and research market trends supporting origination of new opportunities. I am willing to relocate to Victoria and commit to the full 2-year rotational program. Thank you for your consideration.
  </p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br/>
  Drew Williams</p>
