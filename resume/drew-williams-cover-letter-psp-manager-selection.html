  <p>Hiring Committee<br/>
  PSP Investments<br/>
  Montréal, QC</p>

  <p>Dear Hiring Committee,</p>

  <p>
    I am writing to apply for the Analyst/Senior Analyst, External Manager Selection & Monitoring role. I bring a finance background
    (B.Comm, Distinction) and hands-on experience evaluating managers, synthesizing quantitative and qualitative findings, and delivering
    memo-first recommendations to investment committees.
  </p>

  <p>
    As an independent builder I created diligence frameworks that combine strategy scoring, factor exposures, drawdown history, and
    operational assessments. I automated monitoring dashboards (Python/SQL/Excel) that track performance, adherence to guidelines, and
    red flags—supporting timely reviews. At Rosen Capital Advisors I assessed co-investments and fund commitments, producing IC-ready
    materials that covered return expectations, risk, and fit with existing portfolios.
  </p>

  <p>
    PSP’s global mandate and disciplined governance are compelling to me. I value the balance of deep analysis and relationship
    management required to select and monitor external managers effectively. I am confident that my diligence toolkit, writing discipline,
    and stakeholder coordination skills can add immediate value to the External Manager Selection team.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can support PSP’s selection and monitoring
    processes across asset classes.
  </p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br/>
  Drew Williams</p>
