    <h1>Natural Resources Group - Investment Banking Analyst, Calgary</h1>
    <p class="meta">Drew Williams<br />
    Calgary, AB (Hybrid) · 403-618-6113 · Bwillia@ucalgary.ca</p>
    <p>Date: October 3, 2025</p>
    <p>Hiring Committee<br />
    J.P. Morgan, Natural Resources Group<br />
    330 5 Ave SW, Calgary, AB T2P 0L4</p>
    <p>Dear Hiring Committee,</p>
    <p>I am applying for the Investment Banking Analyst role with J.P. Morgan's Natural Resources Group in Calgary. I hold a B.Comm (Finance, Distinction) from the University of Calgary and bring hands-on experience building valuation models, producing investor materials, and delivering analysis under tight timelines.</p>
    <p>At PrairieSignal (prairiesignal.ca), my AI and reporting automation consultancy, I design practical reporting automations that plug into the tools clients already rely on—Excel, SQL exports and collaborative suites. I build valuation-ready workbooks and dashboards that surface variance drivers, stress-test assumptions and roll into executive summaries. Model hygiene, reconciliations and version control are baked in so each cycle is faster and audit-ready.</p>
    <p>Previously at Rosen Capital Advisors, I produced P&L, exposure and risk analytics used in investment reviews and co-authored quarterly and annual investor letters and fact sheets. I also led a compliance and operations platform integration that standardized reporting cadence and delivered $120K per year in vendor savings. The role required coordination across Legal, IT and Operations and sharpened my attention to detail and communication with senior stakeholders.</p>
    <p>As a Private Equity Summer Analyst at Olson Cross and Alamo, I built DCF, IRR and waterfall models and drafted investment memoranda on $350M to $3.5B transactions. That experience strengthened my fundamentals in valuation, due diligence support and industry research. I have continued to follow Canadian energy and mining developments closely, translating market updates into scenario cases I share with clients and peers.</p>
    <p>I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to pitch development, valuation work, industry research and transaction execution alongside a collaborative team. Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can support J.P. Morgan's clients in energy and mining.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br />
    Drew Williams</p>
