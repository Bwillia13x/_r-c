      Real Estate Investment Banking Hiring Team<br />
      BMO Capital Markets<br />
      Toronto, ON
    </p>

    <p>Dear Hiring Team,</p>

    <p>
      I am applying for the Analyst position in BMO Capital Markets' Real Estate
      Investment Banking group. I bring four years of buy-side and analyst
      experience alongside a B.Comm (Distinction, May 2025) from the Haskayne
      School of Business. I have built DCF/IRR and waterfall models,
      comps/precedents, and CIM/pitch materials under tight deadlines, and I am
      eager to apply this foundation to support BMO's Real Estate IB team across
      acquisition/disposition, M&A, and capital markets mandates.
    </p>

    <p>
      My real estate fluency includes REIT comps, NAV and FFO/AFFO modeling,
      property-level NOI and cap rate valuation, and DSCR/LTV-based debt sizing
      across industrial, multifamily, and office portfolios. At PrairieSignal I
      build executive-ready CIM-style packs with reconciliations and audit
      trails, integrate SQL-to-Excel automation to cut reporting cycle time, and
      maintain diligence-style checklists that enable rapid responses to
      buy-side and sell-side requests. Earlier at Rosen Capital Advisors I
      produced investor materials and diligence models, led a cross-department
      platform integration that delivered $120K in annual savings, and
      co-authored LP presentations for fundraising. As a Private Equity Summer
      Analyst at Olson Cross & Alamo, I drafted investment memoranda for
      transactions ranging from $350M to $3.5B and coordinated materials for
      management presentations and due diligence Q&A with banking and legal
      teams.
    </p>

    <p>
      BMO's leadership in real estate investment banking and its commitment to
      client-focused execution resonate strongly with me. I thrive in
      fast-paced, collaborative environments where rigorous financial modeling,
      clear communication, and deadline discipline drive outcomes. I am
      confident I can quickly contribute to pitch preparation, transaction
      support, and client deliverables for BMO's Real Estate IB franchise.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the
      opportunity to bring modeling rigor, process discipline, and real estate
      insight to BMO Capital Markets.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sincerely,<br />
      Drew Williams
