  <p>Hiring Committee<br/>
  CPP Investments, Credit Investments (Strategic Credit)<br/>
  New York, NY</p>

  <p>Dear Hiring Committee,</p>

  <p>
    I am applying for the Analyst position with CPP Investments' Strategic Credit group in New York. I hold a B.Comm (Finance, Distinction) from the University of Calgary and bring hands-on experience building financial models, conducting due diligence and evaluating complex capital structures for investment decisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a Private Equity Summer Analyst at Olson Cross & Alamo, I analyzed $350M-$3.5B transactions including capital structure evaluation, cash flow modeling and recovery analysis for investment decisions. I built valuation models (DCF/IRR, waterfalls) and drafted investment memoranda with risk assessments under tight bid timelines. I conducted due diligence including data room reviews, management meetings and collaboration with external advisors to assess investment opportunities. That experience strengthened my fundamentals in credit analysis, transaction execution and working under compressed timelines—skills directly relevant to evaluating special situation credit opportunities at CPP Investments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Previously at Rosen Capital Advisors, I built dashboards (Excel/Python) and management reports supporting risk, operations, and portfolio reviews. I co-authored quarterly and annual investor letters with the PM and produced diligence models supporting partner reviews. I also led a compliance and operations platform integration that standardized reporting cadence and delivered $120K per year in vendor savings, demonstrating my attention to detail and ability to coordinate with legal, risk and operations teams—skills relevant to structuring deals and closing transactions with internal and external partners.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am excited about the opportunity to research and evaluate special situation credit opportunities across the capital structure, assist in investment execution including modeling recoveries and reviewing legal documents, and prepare investment recommendation decks for the Credit Investment Committee. I am willing to relocate to New York and travel as needed for diligence. Thank you for your consideration.
  </p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br/>
  Drew Williams</p>
