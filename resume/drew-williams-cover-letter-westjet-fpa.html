  <h1>Cover Letter — WestJet FP&A Financial Analyst</h1>

  <p>Hiring Committee<br/>
  WestJet Airlines Ltd., Enterprise FP&A<br/>
  Calgary, AB</p>

  <p>Dear Hiring Committee,</p>

  <p>
    I am applying for the FP&A Financial Analyst role with WestJet's Enterprise FP&A team. I hold a B.Comm (Finance, Distinction) from the University of Calgary and bring hands-on experience building forecasting models, producing executive-ready reporting packages, and delivering variance analysis under tight deadlines.
  </p>

  <p>
    At PrairieSignal (prairiesignal.ca), my AI and reporting automation consultancy, I design practical reporting automations that plug into the tools clients already rely on—Excel, SQL exports and collaborative suites. I build monthly reporting packs with budget vs. actuals, variance commentary, and KPI dashboards; reconciliations, approvals tracking and version control are embedded so each cycle is faster and audit-ready. This experience directly mirrors the monthly financial results and outlook responsibilities at WestJet.
  </p>

  <p>
    Previously at Rosen Capital Advisors, I built dashboards (Excel/Python) and management reports supporting risk, operations, and portfolio reviews; maintained conciliations and assumptions documentation. I also led a compliance and operations platform integration that standardized reporting cadence and delivered $120K per year in vendor savings. The role required coordination across Legal, IT and Operations and sharpened my attention to detail and communication with senior stakeholders—skills directly relevant to presenting monthly financial results to WestJet's VP and C-suite.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to WestJet's forecasting and budgeting models, conduct scenario analysis for strategic initiatives, and collaborate with your Accounting and Operations teams to align financial plans. Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can support WestJet's Enterprise FP&A function in Calgary.
  </p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br/>
  Drew Williams</p>
