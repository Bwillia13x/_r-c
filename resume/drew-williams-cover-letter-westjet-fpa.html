  <p>Hiring Committee<br/>
  WestJet Airlines Ltd.<br/>
  Calgary, AB</p>

  <p>Dear Hiring Committee,</p>

  <p>
    I am excited to apply for the FP&A Financial Analyst role at WestJet. My finance background (B.Comm, Distinction) and
    hands-on experience building driver-based forecasts, scenario models, and executive-ready dashboards align directly with
    WestJet’s need for analytical partners who can connect route profitability, cost structure, and operational metrics to
    actionable recommendations.
  </p>

  <p>
    As an independent builder, I designed FP&A workbenches that integrate demand, utilization, and cost drivers; the tooling
    produces rapid insights for leadership on variance drivers and resource allocation. Previously at Rosen Capital Advisors,
    I led the integration of a compliance and operations platform that reduced vendor spend by $120K annually while
    strengthening reporting cadence across Legal, IT, and Operations. In both settings I translated complex, cross-functional
    data into clear narratives that supported executive decision-making under tight timelines.
  </p>

  <p>
    WestJet’s hybrid model, pace of change, and direct exposure to network and fleet operations are especially appealing to me.
    I have experience partnering with operational leaders, structuring KPIs, and deploying Python/Excel automation to ensure
    the right data is in the right hands. I am ready to bring that mindset to Calgary head office and contribute to your
    September forecast cycle and year-end planning immediately.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for your consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my FP&A toolkit—driver-based modeling,
    variance storytelling, and collaborative execution—can help WestJet continue to deliver industry-leading experiences while
    maintaining financial discipline.
  </p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br/>
  Drew Williams</p>
