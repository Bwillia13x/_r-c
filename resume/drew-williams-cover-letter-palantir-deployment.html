  <p>Deployment Strategist Hiring Team<br/>
  Palantir Technologies<br/>
  Ottawa, ON</p>

  <p>Dear Hiring Team,</p>

  <p>
    I am applying for the Deployment Strategist role. I operate at the intersection of analytics, workflow design, and stakeholder enablement—
    translating ambiguous business problems into actionable, AI-enabled solutions. My background spans Python/SQL automation, product configuration,
    and change management across finance and operations teams.
  </p>

  <p>
    As an independent builder, I partnered with clients to map current-state processes, identify high-leverage opportunities, and prototype
    decision-support systems. I delivered analytics workflows with audit trails, scenario toggles, and documentation that accelerated adoption.
    At Rosen Capital Advisors I led the rollout of a compliance/operations platform across Legal, IT, and Operations, aligning requirements,
    orchestrating training, and realizing $120K in annual vendor savings.
  </p>

  <p>
    Palantir’s mission to pair software with real-world impact resonates strongly with me. I enjoy working alongside cross-functional teams,
    iterating quickly, and building trust through transparent communication and reproducible analysis. I am ready to jump into field deployments,
    drive stakeholder alignment, and help clients realize value from Palantir’s platforms.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to Palantir’s deployment team and support critical
    initiatives across public and private sector clients.
  </p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br/>
  Drew Williams</p>
