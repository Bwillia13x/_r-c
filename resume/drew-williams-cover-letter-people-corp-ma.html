  <h1>Analyst – Corporate Development (M&A Analysis & Diligence), People Corporation</h1>

  <p>Hiring Committee<br/>
  People Corporation, Corporate Development<br/>
  Calgary, AB</p>

  <p>Dear Hiring Committee,</p>

  <p>
    I am applying for the Analyst – Corporate Development position with People Corporation's M&A team. I hold a B.Comm (Finance, Distinction) from the University of Calgary and bring hands-on experience in M&A analysis, financial modeling, due diligence and transaction execution.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a Private Equity Summer Analyst at Olson Cross & Alamo, I modeled 3 potential acquisitions (valuations up to $3.5B) including synergy analysis, directly supporting executive go/no-go decisions. I managed due diligence workstreams including financial analysis, data room reviews and coordination with external advisors to identify key risks. I prepared investment committee memoranda summarizing findings and recommendations for $350M-$3.5B transactions under tight timelines. That experience strengthened my fundamentals in M&A analysis, valuation and deal execution—skills directly relevant to supporting People Corporation's acquisition pipeline.
  </p>

  <p>
    Previously at Rosen Capital Advisors, I led a compliance and operations platform integration that standardized processes and reporting cadence, delivering $120K per year in vendor savings. This project showcases my integration planning mindset and cross-functional project management capabilities—relevant to assisting with integration planning for closed acquisitions. The role required coordination across Legal, IT and Operations and sharpened my attention to detail and confidentiality protocols essential in M&A environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am excited about the opportunity to support People Corporation's M&A pipeline by researching potential acquisition targets, performing financial analysis and modeling, taking the lead on first drafts of investment committee memos, and coordinating due diligence workstreams. Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to People Corporation's growth through strategic acquisitions.
  </p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br/>
  Drew Williams</p>
