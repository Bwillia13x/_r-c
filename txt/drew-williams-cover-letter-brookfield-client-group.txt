Dear Hiring Team,
I am applying for the Analyst/Associate position in Brookfield’s Global Client Group. I bring a finance background alongside hands-on
experience producing investor-facing materials, maintaining CRM data integrity, and automating analytics that inform fundraising and
relationship management.
As an independent builder I have designed dashboards that combine CRM exports, performance KPIs, and pipeline data into executive-ready
narratives. I standardize notes, follow-up actions, and segmentation fields so teams can personalize outreach at scale. Earlier at
Rosen Capital Advisors I owned client-ready materials, coordinated cross-functional inputs, and led a compliance/operations integration
that improved reporting cadence while saving $120K annually. These projects reinforced my attention to detail, documentation discipline,
and ability to communicate complex information succinctly.
Brookfield’s global reach and solution-oriented culture are compelling to me. I thrive in collaborative settings where data hygiene,
insight generation, and crisp storytelling directly support capital raising and client engagement. I am confident I can quickly contribute
to the Global Client Group’s reporting rhythm and CRM initiatives.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to bring analytics, automation, and investor communications
expertise to Brookfield.
Sincerely,
Drew Williams
