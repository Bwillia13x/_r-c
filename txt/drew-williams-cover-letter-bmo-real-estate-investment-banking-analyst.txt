Real Estate Investment Banking Hiring Team BMO Capital Markets Toronto, ON
Dear Hiring Team,
I am applying for the Analyst position in BMO Capital Markets' Real Estate Investment Banking group. I bring four years of buy-side and analyst experience alongside a B.Comm (Distinction, May 2025) from the Haskayne School of Business. I have built DCF/IRR and waterfall models, comps/precedents, and CIM/pitch materials under tight deadlines, and I am eager to apply this foundation to support BMO's Real Estate IB team across acquisition/disposition, M&A, and capital markets mandates.
My real estate fluency includes REIT comps, NAV and FFO/AFFO modeling, property-level NOI and cap rate valuation, and DSCR/LTV-based debt sizing across industrial, multifamily, and office portfolios. At PrairieSignal I build executive-ready CIM-style packs with reconciliations and audit trails, integrate SQL-to-Excel automation to cut reporting cycle time, and maintain diligence-style checklists that enable rapid responses to buy-side and sell-side requests. Earlier at Rosen Capital Advisors I produced investor materials and diligence models, led a cross-department platform integration that delivered $120K in annual savings, and co-authored LP presentations for fundraising. As a Private Equity Summer Analyst at Olson Cross & Alamo, I drafted investment memoranda for transactions ranging from $350M to $3.5B and coordinated materials for management presentations and due diligence Q&A with banking and legal teams.
BMO's leadership in real estate investment banking and its commitment to client-focused execution resonate strongly with me. I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments where rigorous financial modeling, clear communication, and deadline discipline drive outcomes. I am confident I can quickly contribute to pitch preparation, transaction support, and client deliverables for BMO's Real Estate IB franchise.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to bring modeling rigor, process discipline, and real estate insight to BMO Capital Markets.
Sincerely, Drew Williams
