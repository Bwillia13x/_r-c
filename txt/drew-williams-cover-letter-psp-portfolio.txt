Dear Hiring Committee,
I am applying for the Analyst/Senior Analyst, Portfolio Management role within PSP’s Infrastructure & Private Equity group. I bring a finance
degree (B.Comm, Distinction) and practical experience building asset-level dashboards, valuation oversight models, and governance materials that
keep investment teams, risk, and finance aligned.
As an independent builder I constructed portfolio monitoring suites that track KPIs, valuation marks, capital plans, and governance milestones.
Using Python/SQL/Excel automations I reconciled data sources, surfaced variance narratives, and packaged findings for investment committees.
Previously at Rosen Capital Advisors I prepared board materials for portfolio companies, ran scenario analysis on capital allocation decisions,
and led a compliance/ops integration that improved reporting cadence while saving $120K annually.
PSP’s global infrastructure and PE holdings present the complexity and impact I’m eager to support. I enjoy partnering with deal teams and operating
leaders, maintaining disciplined documentation, and ensuring recommendations are grounded in both financial and operational reality.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the chance to contribute to PSP’s portfolio governance, analytics, and strategic initiatives
from day one.
Sincerely,
Drew Williams
