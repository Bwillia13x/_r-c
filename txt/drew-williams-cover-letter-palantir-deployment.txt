Deployment Strategist Hiring Team
Palantir Technologies
Ottawa, ON
Dear Hiring Team,
I am applying for the Deployment Strategist role. I operate at the intersection of analytics, workflow design, and stakeholder enablement—
translating ambiguous business problems into actionable, AI-enabled solutions. My background spans Python/SQL automation, product configuration,
and change management across finance and operations teams.
As an independent builder, I partnered with clients to map current-state processes, identify high-leverage opportunities, and prototype
decision-support systems. I delivered analytics workflows with audit trails, scenario toggles, and documentation that accelerated adoption.
At Rosen Capital Advisors I led the rollout of a compliance/operations platform across Legal, IT, and Operations, aligning requirements,
orchestrating training, and realizing $120K in annual vendor savings.
Palantir’s mission to pair software with real-world impact resonates strongly with me. I enjoy working alongside cross-functional teams,
iterating quickly, and building trust through transparent communication and reproducible analysis. I am ready to jump into field deployments,
drive stakeholder alignment, and help clients realize value from Palantir’s platforms.
Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to Palantir’s deployment team and support critical
initiatives across public and private sector clients.
Sincerely,
Drew Williams
