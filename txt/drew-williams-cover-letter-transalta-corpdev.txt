Dear Hiring Team,
I am writing to apply for the Corporate Development Analyst role at TransAlta. I bring a finance background (B.Comm, Distinction)
and hands-on experience evaluating energy and infrastructure investments, developing thesis-driven models, and shepherding
diligence workstreams that align strategy with returns.
At Rosen Capital Advisors I led valuation and diligence support for platform add-ons across energy and infrastructure adjacencies.
I built DCF, LBO, and accretion/dilution models, framed strategic fit, and drafted investment committee materials that guided
$350M–$3.5B decisions. More recently, as an independent builder, I have developed deal-screening playbooks that combine market
intelligence, regulatory signals, and asset-level KPIs—producing concise go/no-go recommendations and scenario toggles for
energy transition opportunities.
TransAlta’s focus on renewables and decarbonization, coupled with its active corporate development program, is an excellent fit for
my interest in energy transition. I have already built models incorporating carbon pricing, policy incentives, and commodity curves,
and I enjoy cross-functional collaboration with strategy, finance, and technical teams to stress test assumptions and structure deals.
I would be excited to contribute to TransAlta’s pipeline immediately—bringing disciplined financial analysis, structured diligence,
and crisp communication to support investment committees and executive sponsors. Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Drew Williams
