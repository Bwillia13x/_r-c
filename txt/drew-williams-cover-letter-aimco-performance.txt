Dear Hiring Team,
I am writing to express my interest in the Performance Measurement Analyst opportunity at AIMCo. I bring a finance degree (B.Comm, Distinction)
and institutional-style reporting experience, including attribution analysis, benchmark comparisons, and memo-first narratives for investment committees.
As an independent builder I constructed performance dashboards that consolidate returns, benchmarks, and factor exposures across asset classes. Using Python,
SQL, and Excel, I automated reconciliations, variance diagnostics, and KPI narratives that equip CIO teams with timely insights. During my tenure at Rosen Capital Advisors,
I maintained P&L and VaR dashboards, supported attribution for partner reviews, and led a compliance/operations integration that improved reporting cadence while reducing vendor spend by $120K annually.
AIMCo’s mission and scale are compelling to me. I thrive in environments where data governance, accuracy, and thoughtful interpretation drive decisions. The opportunity to work within an institutional
performance team—ensuring metrics are rigorous and accessible to internal/external stakeholders—aligns well with my toolkit and professional goals.
Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the chance to contribute to AIMCo’s reporting cycles immediately, bringing analytical depth, documentation discipline, and clear storytelling to the performance measurement function.
Sincerely,
Drew Williams
