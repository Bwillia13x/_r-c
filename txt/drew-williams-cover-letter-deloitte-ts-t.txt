Deloitte Canada — Technology, Strategy & Transformation
Toronto, ON
Dear Hiring Committee,
I am applying for the Analyst/Consultant position within Deloitte's Technology, Strategy & Transformation practice. I bring a finance
foundation (B.Comm, Distinction) and hands-on experience designing analytics tooling, operating model playbooks, and AI-enabled workflows
that connect technology initiatives to measurable business outcomes.
As an independent builder, I partner with clients to translate ambiguous needs into requirements, roadmaps, and change enablement materials.
I have delivered Python/SQL analytics prototypes, valuation engines, and executive-ready dashboards with documentation that enables reuse.
Previously at Rosen Capital Advisors I led a compliance/operations platform integration, aligning stakeholders across Legal, IT, and Operations
while reducing vendor spend by $120K annually.
Deloitte TS&T’s focus on technology strategy, operating models, and transformation is an ideal match for my interests. I am comfortable working
in fast-paced, collaborative environments, structuring complex problems, and communicating clearly with executives and delivery teams alike.
Thank you for considering my application ahead of the September 24 deadline. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your
engagements and support your clients’ strategic outcomes.
Sincerely,
Drew Williams
