Dear Hiring Committee,
I am writing to apply for the Analyst/Senior Analyst, External Manager Selection & Monitoring role. I bring a finance background
(B.Comm, Distinction) and hands-on experience evaluating managers, synthesizing quantitative and qualitative findings, and delivering
memo-first recommendations to investment committees.
As an independent builder I created diligence frameworks that combine strategy scoring, factor exposures, drawdown history, and
operational assessments. I automated monitoring dashboards (Python/SQL/Excel) that track performance, adherence to guidelines, and
red flags—supporting timely reviews. At Rosen Capital Advisors I assessed co-investments and fund commitments, producing IC-ready
materials that covered return expectations, risk, and fit with existing portfolios.
PSP’s global mandate and disciplined governance are compelling to me. I value the balance of deep analysis and relationship
management required to select and monitor external managers effectively. I am confident that my diligence toolkit, writing discipline,
and stakeholder coordination skills can add immediate value to the External Manager Selection team.
Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can support PSP’s selection and monitoring
processes across asset classes.
Sincerely,
Drew Williams
