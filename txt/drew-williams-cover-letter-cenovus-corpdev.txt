Calgary, AB
Dear Hiring Team,
I am eager to join Cenovus as a Corporate Development Analyst. I combine a finance foundation (B.Comm, Distinction) with hands-on
experience evaluating integrated energy assets, modelling synergies across upstream, midstream, and downstream, and communicating
strategy through executive-ready materials.
Recently, I have been building integrated valuation models for operators that span production, logistics, and refining margins.
These frameworks include scenario toggles for crude differentials, policy changes, and ESG targets—exactly the elements that shape
Cenovus's capital allocation. At Rosen Capital Advisors I led deal modelling and integration planning, partnering with finance,
operations, and legal stakeholders to ensure recommendations were actionable and timed with operating cadence.
Cenovus’s blended portfolio and focus on disciplined capital deployment are compelling to me. I am comfortable translating engineering
inputs into financial metrics, coordinating cross-functional diligence, and storytelling through concise memos that help senior
leaders choose the right path. I thrive in collaborative environments where analytical depth and clear communication drive impact.
I would welcome the opportunity to contribute immediately to Cenovus’s corporate development pipeline—building models, synthesizing
market intelligence, and supporting integration efforts. Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Drew Williams
