Dear Hiring Team,
I am applying for the Analyst/Consultant role in Deloitte's Technology, Strategy & Transformation practice. I bring a
finance foundation (B.Comm, with Distinction) coupled with hands-on build of analytics and decision tooling—Python/SQL
dashboards, valuation engines, and executive-ready reporting flows. I am motivated by work that connects technology
capabilities to real business outcomes and change.
At Rosen Capital Advisors, I led the integration of a compliance and operations platform that reduced vendor spend by
$120K annually and improved cadence across Legal, IT, and Operations. As a summer analyst in private equity, I reviewed
$350M–$3.5B transactions, built IRR and waterfall models, and drafted investment committee-ready materials. I translate
ambiguity into structured requirements and practical roadmaps, and I enjoy partnering with stakeholders to design
operating models and simple, testable pilots.
I am familiar with enterprise technology concepts (cloud, ERP/enterprise apps, digital workplace) and comfortable
learning client-specific stacks. My approach emphasizes memo-first thinking, KPI hygiene, and repeatable analysis. I
thrive in environments where clarity, iteration, and communication drive value.
I would be excited to bring this mindset to Deloitte TS&T—contributing to technology strategy, operating models, and
business–IT alignment engagements. Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I
can support your clients and teams.
Sincerely,
Drew Williams
