Dear Hiring Team,
I am applying for the Corporate Development Analyst position at CNRL. I bring upstream-focused financial modelling experience,
repeatable diligence workflows, and a collaborative style that supports engineering, operations, and finance teams in screening
acquisitions, divestitures, and portfolio trades.
As an independent builder, I developed A&D evaluation engines that ingest production, reserves, and cost data to surface top-quartile
opportunities. The analyses include decline-curve modelling, type-curve comparisons, and sensitivity toggles for commodity strips and
operating synergies. Previously at Rosen Capital Advisors I coordinated multi-disciplinary diligence teams, built cash-flow and return
models, and prepared investment committee materials for energy and infrastructure transactions ranging from $350M to $3.5B.
CNRL’s scale, disciplined capital allocation, and appetite for opportunistic acquisitions are an ideal match for my skills. I understand
the importance of grounding models in engineering assumptions, maintaining data provenance, and presenting concise recommendations that
can move at the pace of deal negotiations.
I would welcome the chance to support CNRL’s corporate development pipeline—providing valuation rigour, market intelligence, and organized
execution across the evaluation lifecycle. Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
Drew Williams
