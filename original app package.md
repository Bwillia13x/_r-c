J.P. Morgan, Natural Resources Group
330 5 Ave SW, Calgary, AB T2P 0L4
Dear Hiring Committee,
I am applying for the Investment Banking Analyst role with J.P. Morgan's Natural Resources
Group in Calgary. I hold a B.Comm (Finance, Distinction) from the University of Calgary and
bring hands-on experience building valuation models, producing investor materials, and
delivering analysis under tight timelines.
At PrairieSignal (prairiesignal.ca), my AI and reporting automation consultancy, I design
practical reporting automations that plug into the tools clients already rely on—Excel, SQL
exports and collaborative suites. I build valuation-ready workbooks and dashboards that
surface variance drivers, stress-test assumptions and roll into executive summaries. Model
hygiene, reconciliations and version control are baked in so each cycle is faster and audit-ready.
Previously at Rosen Capital Advisors, I produced P&L, exposure and risk analytics used in
investment reviews and co-authored quarterly and annual investor letters and fact sheets. I also
led a compliance and operations platform integration that standardized reporting cadence and
delivered $120K per year in vendor savings. The role required coordination across Legal, IT and
Operations and sharpened my attention to detail and communication with senior stakeholders.
As a Private Equity Summer Analyst at Olson Cross and Alamo, I built DCF, IRR and waterfall
models and drafted investment memoranda on $350M to $3.5B transactions. That experience
strengthened my fundamentals in valuation, due diligence support and industry research. I
have continued to follow Canadian energy and mining developments closely, translating market
updates into scenario cases I share with clients and peers.
I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to pitch development, valuation work, industry
research and transaction execution alongside a collaborative team. Thank you for your
consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can support J.P. Morgan's
clients in energy and mining.

Hiring Committee
University of Calgary, Facilities Development, Capital Renewal
Calgary, AB
Dear Hiring Committee,
I am applying for the Financial Analyst (Capital Reporting) position supporting the University
of Calgary's Capital Program. My finance background (B.Comm, Distinction from Haskayne)
and hands-on experience building monthly reporting packs, reconciliations, and audit-ready
documentation align directly with the University's need for accurate budgeting, forecasting, and
variance analysis across capital projects.
Through PrairieSignal, I design lightweight reporting automations that work with existing tools
—Excel, SQL exports, and data warehouse/BI feeds—to deliver monthly capital packs with
budget vs. actuals, variance commentary, and KPI summaries. Reconciliations, approvals
tracking, and version control are embedded so each cycle is simpler and more reliable. I focus
on ensuring expenditures are properly documented, grant terms are respected, and project
managers and directors receive timely, actionable information.
Previously at Rosen Capital Advisors, I served as the primary analyst for an SPX weekly options
volatility arbitrage strategy. I maintained hedge books, Greeks, and derivatives exposure
models that guided capital allocation, co-authored quarterly and annual investor letters, and
produced fact sheets and diligence models. Alongside that portfolio work, I led a compliance
and operations platform integration that reduced vendor spend by $120K annually while
standardizing reporting cadence across Legal, IT, and Operations. That experience honed my
ability to structure complex problems, align stakeholders, and deliver precise outputs under
pressure—skills directly relevant to capital program reporting and government submissions.
I am comfortable working inside enterprise environments (PeopleSoft project codes, internal
controls checklists, cross-functional coordination) and have exposure to public-sector reporting
considerations (PSAS familiarity).
Thank you for considering my application ahead of the October 7 deadline. I look forward to the
opportunity to discuss how I can support Facilities Development in delivering accurate, timely
capital reporting across construction and planning portfolios.
Sincerely,
Drew Williams
